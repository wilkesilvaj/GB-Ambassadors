                        <p>Gracie Barra Pacific Northwest is implementing the GB Ambassadors Program as a platform to 
                            united all of our team members in the Pacific Northwest region in support of our top performing 
                            athletes. It is our goal to bring all of our schools, instructors, and students together on an 
                            effort to help build a great competition team and support individual athletes achieve their full 
                            potential in competition.</p>
                            <p>The GB Ambassadors is not a fund raising program. It is rather a team 
                            effort designed to build unity within GB in pursuit of excellence in competitive Jiu-Jitsu. 
                            Eligibility to receive grants from the GB Ambassadors Pacific Northwest is conditioned to 
                            qualifying criteria applicable to the individual athlete and his home school.</p>

                <h2 class = "center">SPECIAL PRIVATE TRAINING</h2>
                <p>With an estructure really similar to a seminar, the Special Private Training will serve a limited group 
                    of people approaching a specific Jiu Jitsu theme.</p>
    
                <p>The sessions won't have more than 12 people on it, and it's a great opportunity to work on any gaps that 
                    you might have on your game, or improve your Jiu-Jitsu techniques with more advanced details.</p>
                        
                <p>These classes will be hosted by every Gracie Barra School in the State, and will have 2 Ambassadors 
                    teaching the techniques. </p>
                        
                <p class = "padding-bottom">70% of the funds generated will be redirected to the GB Ambassadors Program Pacific Northwest, and the other 30% for the Instructors.</p>

                <p class = "padding-bottom white">The GB Ambassadors Program Pacific Northwest is a initiative to support our Regional Gracie Barra Athletes in their journey of competing in the biggest Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Tournaments worldwide.
    
                The Ambassadors Program is also an opportunity to unite even more the Gracie Barra Pacific Northwest Team, while there will be lots of events in all the GB Schools around the pacific northwest region!

                <h2 class = "center">OUR PURPOSE</h2>
                <p>There are two purposes to the GB Ambassador Pacific Northwest Program.</p>                  
                <p>Firstly, the goal of the GB Ambassador Pacific Northwest Program is to unite everyone behind Gracie Barra. It’s a method to boost everybody’s training, connect the Professors and students, build greater unity in the team, reinforce the values of Gracie Barra, develop a stronger presence in Pacific Northwest and strengthen the technical level of all our GB students through different events.
                For example, GB Training Days, GB Seminars and GB Special Private Training sessions. It strives to generate greater unity behind the GB Team.</p>
               
                <p>Secondly, the aim of the GB Ambassador Pacific Northwest Program is to help fund our athletes to achieve their dreams at major competitions around the world.
                Our goal is for as many members of the GB community to participate in the program as possible. By participating in our events throughout the year, the GB  Ambassador Pacific Northwest Program will grow and enable us to potentially expand in the years to come. </p>
                <p class = "padding-bottom">While the GB Ambassador Pacific Northwest Program is directed at our athletes, other members of the GB community in Pacific Northwest will see benefits as well.
                Not only will the level of training improve, but the GB community will witness a greater alignment in the values and philosophies that are encouraged by Gracie Barra, and therefore will enable the culture within GB to flourish and be nurtured to create a stronger, more successful and bigger team than ever before.
                Here are some thoughts from our Head Instructor on the GB Ambassadors Program
