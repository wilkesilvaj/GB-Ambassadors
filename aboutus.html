                    <p>Gracie Barra Pacific Northwest is implementing the GB Ambassadors Program as a platform to 
                        united all of our team members in the Pacific Northwest region in support of our top performing 
                        athletes. It is our goal to bring all of our schools, instructors, and students together on an 
                        effort to help build a great competition team and support individual athletes achieve their full 
                        potential in competition. The GB Ambassadors is not a fund raising program. It is rather a team 
                        effort designed to build unity within GB in pursuit of excellence in competitive Jiu-Jitsu. 
                        Eligibility to receive grants from the GB Ambassadors Pacific Northwest is conditioned to 
                        qualifying criteria applicable to the individual athlete and his home school.</p>

            <h2>SPECIAL PRIVATE TRAINING</h2>
            <p>With an estructure really similar to a seminar, the Special Private Training will serve a limited group 
                of people approaching a specific Jiu Jitsu theme.</p>

            <p>The sessions won't have more than 12 people on it, and it's a great opportunity to work on any gaps that 
                you might have on your game, or improve your Jiu-Jitsu techniques with more advanced details.</p>
                    
            <p>These classes will be hosted by every Gracie Barra School in the State, and will have 2 Ambassadors 
                teaching the techniques. </p>
                    
            <p>70% of the funds generated will be redirected to the GB Ambassadors Program Arizona, and the other 30% for the Instructors.</p>
